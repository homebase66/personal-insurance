                                                                                                    <p>If you live in one state but get into an accident in another state, your personal insurance coverage will not cover the costs of your injuries. Instead, you will have to get a separate policy for personal injury protection (PIP) if you are injured in another state. This type of coverage is often referred to as “non-resident coverage” or “out-of-state coverage.” There are two types of non-resident coverage: Out-of-state liability coverage and out-of-state medical coverage. Out-of-state liability coverage protects you if you are sued for damages in another state. Out-of-state medical coverage protects you if you are injured in another state and need medical treatment. Both types of non-resident coverage are optional and not required by law. They are designed to supplement your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy if you get into an accident outside of your state of residence and need help covering your medical bills or any other losses that result from the accident.</p><h2>Out-of-state liability coverage</h2><p>If you get into an accident while driving in another state, your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy will cover your medical bills and other losses. However, if you have passengers in your car and those passengers suffer injuries as a result of your accident, they may be able to sue you for damages if you do not have enough insurance coverage. Out-of-state liability coverage protects you if you are sued for damages and do not have enough insurance coverage to pay the claim. Out-of-state liability coverage comes in two forms: Full coverage and liability only.Full coverage out-of-state liability coverage protects you if you are sued for damages and do not have enough insurance to cover the claim. Full coverage out-of-state liability coverage is the most expensive type of out-of-state liability coverage. It costs about $100 a year for each person you insure with the coverage. If you have a family, you may want to consider getting partial coverage instead. Partial coverage out-of-state liability coverage protects you if you are sued for damages and do not have enough insurance to cover the claim. Partial coverage out-of-state liability coverage costs about $50 a year for each person you insure with the coverage. If you have a family, you may want to consider getting full coverage instead.</p><h2>Out-of-state medical coverage</h2><p>If you are injured in an accident outside of your state of residence and need medical treatment, you may have to pay the entire cost of your medical bills out of pocket. If you do not have enough money to cover your medical bills, you may be able to get financial assistance from your out-of-state medical coverage. Out-of-state medical coverage is optional and not required by law. It is designed to supplement your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy if you get into an accident outside of your state of residence and need help covering your medical bills or any other losses that result from the accident. Out-of-state medical coverage costs about $50 a year for each person you insure with the coverage. If you have a family, you may want to consider getting full coverage instead.</p><h2>Tips for getting non-resident coverage</h2><p>Before you get non-resident coverage, make sure you understand the coverage and what it covers. The best way to do this is to compare the different types of non-resident coverage side by side and decide which one best meets your needs. There are a number of factors to consider when comparing non-resident coverage. You should take a look at the following factors when comparing non-resident coverage:</p><h2>Be aware of the limits of your coverage</h2><p>The best way to determine if you need non-resident coverage is to compare the limits of your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy with the limits of your non-resident coverage. If the limits of your non-resident coverage are lower than the limits of your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy, you may not have enough coverage if you get into an accident outside of your state of residence and need help covering your medical bills or any other losses that result from the accident. You should also take a look at the deductibles of your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy and your non-resident coverage. The higher the deductibles, the less your coverage will cost in the event of an accident. If you have a high deductible, you should increase your coverage to avoid having to pay out-of-pocket for your medical bills.</p><h2>Find out if you will be covered if you are hit by a car</h2><p>If you are injured in an accident and a car hits you and causes you to be taken to the emergency room, your non-resident coverage may not pay for your medical bills. If this happens, you will have to pay the entire cost of your medical bills out of pocket. Your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy will cover the rest of your medical bills if you are injured in an accident and a car hits you. If you do not have enough coverage to cover your medical bills, you should increase your non-resident coverage to make sure you are fully covered. You should also make sure you get the maximum medical benefits under your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy. The maximum medical benefits under your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy will determine how much you will be paid if you are injured in an accident and a car hits you.</p><h2>Ask your insurance company if they offer non-resident coverage</h2><p>If you are shopping for non-resident coverage, you should ask your insurance company if they offer non-resident coverage. Some insurance companies do not offer non-resident coverage because they believe their state-mandated personal auto insurance policy is sufficient. If your insurance company does not offer non-resident coverage, you can shop for non-resident coverage on your own. You can shop for non-resident coverage on websites like e-Carrier, Insure.com and Insurancenet. You can also contact your state’s insurance commissioner’s office to find out if your insurance company offers non-resident coverage and other information about your state’s auto insurance laws. You can also visit your state’s insurance department website to find out more about your state’s auto insurance laws.</p><h2>Find out if your employer offers non-resident coverage</h2><p>If you work for a company that provides health insurance to its employees, you may be eligible for non-resident coverage. Your employer may offer non-resident coverage as part of your health insurance policy. You should check your health insurance policy to see if it offers non-resident coverage. If it does, you may want to take advantage of the coverage. You may be able to get non-resident coverage for less money than you would pay for non-resident coverage on your own.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>Non-resident coverage is optional and not required by law. It is designed to supplement your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy if you get into an accident outside of your state of residence and need help covering your medical bills or any other losses that result from the accident. If you get into an accident outside of your state of residence, you may have to pay the entire cost of your medical bills. You should take a look at the limits of your non-resident coverage and the deductibles of your state-mandated personal auto insurance policy to determine if you need to increase your coverage. You should also ask your insurance company if they offer non-resident coverage.</p>
