                                                                                                    <p>When you shop for personal insurance, you’ll likely find that there are several exclusions in most policies. Most people know about the standard exclusions for things like car accidents, medical bills, and theft. But what about those unexpected things that can happen before you even get a chance to purchase coverage? The following are some common exclusions that are often overlooked when shopping for personal insurance:</p><h2>Loss of License/Admission to Rehab If You’re Intoxicated</h2><p>If you’re found intoxicated and arrested, it’s likely that you’ll be charged with a DUI. If you’re convicted, you could lose your license and/or be required to attend a rehab program. Depending on your state, this could also affect your ability to get coverage from an auto insurance company.Many auto insurance policies will exclude coverage for injuries sustained while under the influence of alcohol. If you’re convicted of a DUI, this may be enough to deny your claim altogether. If you’re convicted of a lesser charge, such as an impaired driving charge, your auto insurance policy may offer coverage for medical bills resulting from the accident. However, the coverage amount may be extremely low.</p><h2>Loss of Income If You’re Incarcerated</h2><p>If you’re convicted of a crime and sentenced to jail, you may lose your job. If you don’t have coverage for the loss of income, you may be forced to pay for your medical bills out of your own pocket.Even if you don’t have a job right now, it’s important to have personal insurance to help cover the cost of medical bills. Many people don’t realize that many personal insurance policies exclude coverage for medical bills if you’re incarcerated. This means that if you’re convicted of a crime and sentenced to jail, you could be responsible for covering the cost of your own medical bills.</p><h2>Loss of Assets If You’re Victimized By Fraud</h2><p>If you’re a victim of fraud and lose a large amount of money due to the fraud, it may be difficult to get coverage from an insurance company. If you’re convicted of fraud, it is likely that you’ll be charged with money laundering, which could lead to a conviction and jail time.If you’re convicted of fraud and lose a large amount of money due to the fraud, it may be difficult to get coverage from an insurance company. If you’re convicted of fraud, it is likely that you’ll be charged with money laundering, which could lead to a conviction and jail time. If you lose a large amount of money due to fraud, it may be difficult to get coverage from an insurance company. If you’re convicted of fraud, it is likely that you’ll be charged with money laundering, which could lead to a conviction and jail time.</p><h2>Loss of Life If You’re a Victim of a Car Accident</h2><p>If you’re a passenger in a car accident and the car collides with another vehicle, you may sustain serious injuries. If you’re killed in the accident, your family could be left with a large amount of medical bills and other expenses. If you have a valid policy of personal insurance, it may cover the cost of your medical bills.However, if you don’t have a valid policy of personal insurance, the car accident could be catastrophic to your family. If you’re killed in the car accident, your family would be responsible for covering the cost of your medical bills. If they don’t have the money to pay for your medical bills, they could be responsible for the entire cost.The best way to ensure that your family is protected if you’re killed in a car accident is to get a personal insurance policy. If you’re not covered by a personal insurance policy, the car accident could be catastrophic to your family.</p><h2>Loss of Life If You’re a Victim of Medical Malpractice</h2><p>As a general rule, medical malpractice insurance doesn’t cover normal, everyday medical treatment. For example, if you visit the doctor for a routine check-up and he negligently performs the wrong test, the insurance company won’t cover the cost of the test.If you’re a victim of medical malpractice, it may be difficult to get coverage from an insurance company. If you’re convicted of medical malpractice, it is likely that you’ll be charged with fraud, which could lead to a conviction and jail time.If you’re convicted of medical malpractice, it is likely that you’ll be charged with fraud, which could lead to a conviction and jail time. If you’re convicted of medical malpractice, it is likely that you’ll be charged with fraud, which could lead to a conviction and jail time. If you’re convicted of medical malpractice, it is likely that you’ll be charged with fraud, which could lead to a conviction and jail time.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The above list is just a small sampling of the many common exclusions in personal insurance policies. Before purchasing coverage, it’s important to be aware of all of the potential exclusions in your policy. This way, you can make an informed decision when shopping for coverage.If you’re in the market for personal insurance, it’s important to shop around and compare different policies.
