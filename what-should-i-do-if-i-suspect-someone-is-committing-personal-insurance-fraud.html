It’s a serious crime, and it’s up to you as an insured person to report it if you suspect someone is committing it. If someone is committing insurance fraud, it can put you at risk of losing coverage. In some cases, you might be denied coverage altogether. If you report the fraud, the company will investigate the claim. If they find that it was fraudulent, they will likely end your coverage. That’s why it’s important to report any suspicions of insurance fraud immediately. If you wait and don’t report it, it could cost you coverage for years to come.</p><h2>What are the signs of insurance fraud?</h2><p>There are many signs of insurance fraud, but not all of them are obvious. Some of the most common signs of insurance fraud include: - A sudden increase in medical expenses - A sudden change in health - A sudden change in lifestyle - A sudden change in personal habits - A sudden change in the way you normally treat your health - A sudden change in your home or vehicle - A sudden change in your employment - A sudden change in your ability to work - A sudden change in your address - A sudden change in your income</p><h2>How to report insurance fraud</h2><p>If you suspect someone is committing insurance fraud, you should report it immediately. You can report insurance fraud to your insurance company directly or to the insurance fraud prevention unit (IFPU) operated by the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). You can also report the crime to your local police department. You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if you suspect that an insurance company is committing fraud against its customers.</p><h2>How does insurance fraud affect you?</h2><p>If you report insurance fraud, the insurance company might not immediately terminate your coverage. Instead, they might put a stop on your coverage while they investigate. This is called “putting a stop loss” and it’s a common way that insurance companies handle fraud. If you report insurance fraud, you might also be denied coverage in the future. Insurance fraud can make you more likely to be denied coverage in the future. If you’re denied coverage, you might have to pay a higher premium to get the same level of protection.</p><h2>Why should you report insurance fraud?</h2><p>Insurance fraud can put you at risk of losing your coverage and paying a higher premium.
