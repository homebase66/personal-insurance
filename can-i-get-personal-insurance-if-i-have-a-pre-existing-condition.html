The good news is that most health insurance plans do not exclude pre-existing conditions. But, you may have to pay higher premiums and may not be able to find a policy that covers you. If you have a pre-existing condition and cannot find affordable health insurance, there are still ways to get coverage and protect yourself from financial ruin if an unexpected illness comes your way.</p><h2>Are there any special conditions for buying health insurance if you have a pre-existing condition?</h2><p>Depending on your state, you may have to meet certain requirements to purchase health insurance. Many states require you to purchase a health insurance plan that is compliant with the “essential health benefits” outlined in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA also has a pre-existing condition waiver program that allows individuals with pre-existing conditions to purchase coverage from a state’s insurance exchange if they cannot find insurance that covers their pre-existing condition.</p><h2>Should you buy a catastrophic health insurance plan?</h2><p>A catastrophic health insurance plan is designed for those who have a high health risk. If you have a pre-existing condition, you may not be able to find affordable health insurance that covers your pre-existing condition. In this case, you may want to consider a catastrophic health insurance plan. These plans have higher premiums, but they do not have any pre-existing condition exclusions. They are also not subject to the same health underwriting guidelines as other health insurance plans.</p><h2>Should you buy a short-term health insurance plan?</h2><p>Short-term health insurance plans are not subject to the same health underwriting guidelines as other health insurance plans. Short-term health insurance plans are designed for individuals who have a pre-existing condition and cannot find affordable health insurance. Short-term health insurance plans are a good option for individuals who want to get coverage quickly, but do not have time to shop for health insurance. Short-term health insurance plans are not meant to be a long-term solution for individuals who have a pre-existing condition and cannot find affordable health insurance.</p><h2>Should you buy a long-term health insurance plan?</h2><p>A long-term health insurance plan is a good option for individuals who have a pre-existing condition and cannot find affordable health insurance. Long-term health insurance plans are subject to the same health underwriting guidelines as other health insurance plans. Long-term health insurance plans are designed to provide continuous coverage to individuals who have a pre-existing condition. Long-term health insurance plans are a good option for individuals who want to get coverage quickly, but do not have time to shop for health insurance.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Getting health insurance after a pre-existing condition used to be a nightmare, but these days it’s not so scary.
