It’s inevitable, and unfortunately comes with a risk of damage or injury if you’re not prepared. A good umbrella policy can protect you from that risk and help keep your finances safe from the financial fallout of an accident. But how much does an umbrella policy cost? The price of an umbrella policy will vary depending on several factors, including the amount of coverage, the length of the policy term, and the type of carrier. It’s important to understand all of these variables before making a decision on which policy is right for you and your family. Here we explain everything you need to know about umbrella insurance so you can make the best decision for you and your family based on your unique circumstances.</p><h2>What is an umbrella policy?</h2><p>An umbrella policy is additional liability coverage that protects you from claims beyond the limits of your auto and home insurance policies. An umbrella policy kicks in to cover the rest of your assets, including money owed to you if another party files a lawsuit against you for damages. If you’re sued, your primary insurance policies will typically cover your legal defense costs up to their limits. However, if the lawsuit is for more than your primary policies cover, the rest is paid out of your own pocket. An umbrella policy kicks in after your primary policies have been used up, so you’re protected from further financial loss. An umbrella policy is designed to protect you from liability claims that exceed the limits of your auto and home insurance policies. It’s an additional layer of protection for your assets that kicks in once your insurance needs are met.</p><h2>Is an umbrella policy right for you?</h2><p>If you own a home or have a lot of personal assets, an umbrella policy could be a good idea.
